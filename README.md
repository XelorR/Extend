# Extend

My personal **Extend** (navigation/edition/function, also known as "Nav") layer rethink, inspired by existing solutions made by [DreymaR](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2014-extend-extra-extreme/) and [Stevep99](https://github.com/stevep99/keyboard-tweaks/tree/master/ExtendLayer).
Refer to [Extend layers](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/extend.html) to know more
